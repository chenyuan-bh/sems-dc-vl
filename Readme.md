# sems-dc-vl

This repository contains code for UAV Visual Localization via Integrated Steerable Semantic Feature Learning and
Density-based Clustering

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/chenyuan-bh/sems-dc-vl.git && \
conda create --name semsnet python=3.8 -y && \
pip install -r requirements.txt && \
conda activate semsnet
```

## Preparation

Configure paths and parameters in yaml file.

```
model_path: path to trained model
img_list: path to txt file that lists the names of UAV images
img0_paths: directory of UAV images
img1_paths: path to satellite imagery 

```

The trained model can be downloaded
from [drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_A17MJ0rMO6bAIkOxhNdKidTHixnuOEp/view?usp=sharing).

## Run

```shell
python image_matching.py --config matching_eval_base.yaml
```

or

```shell
python image_matching_whole.py --config matching_eval.yaml
```

## Training

### Data Preparation

- [GL3D](https://github.com/lzx551402/GL3D)
- Semantic segmentation framework and model for labels
  generation: [SSA](https://github.com/fudan-zvg/Semantic-Segment-Anything), [SegFormer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/segformer):

### Train

Training details are presented in the manuscript. Scripts for training are coming soon.
